# Characterization 

  Quantifying molecules behavior in different condition.

## Contents
  
  - FDcurve:
  
    Featuring molecule behavior while being deformed by changing distance between two ends (in the code: carboxylates in particularly). The calculation relies on mostly forces changing tendency along deformation.
    
  - config folder:
  
    LAMMPS script for optimizing molecules, deforming simulation and hessian data generating.
    _\*Noticing that freqSpectrum.py and dump.py only work with python2_
